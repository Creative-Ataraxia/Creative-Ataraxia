### Hi there.

I'm Roy, a senior Data & AI engineer with a systems architect's mindset. I focus on building robust, scalable infrastructures with governance best practices to solve real business problems, not showing off coding for coding's sake.

* I lead cloud migration efforts, maintain data pipelines, deploy agents and RAG systems, and optimize real-time streaming data pipelines.
* I build data platforms that are scalable, observable, and governed as required by your data team:
    * Lightweight stacks (Airbyte + dbt + DuckDB + Dagster + Docker)
    * Cloud-native platforms (Kafka/Flink + S3/ADLS/Delta + Spark + BigQuery/Snowflake + Airflow + Docker)
* I also have four years of full-time experience integrating LLMs into workflows. I'm proficient in most prompt tuning techniques and structures, and good at steering LLMs to produce the outputs we want. I have participated in several featured LLM competitions on Kaggle, and I am currently ranked 0.8% on Kaggle.

I'm a U.S. national, so I'm authorized to work in the U.S., and I'm open to relocation to any parts of the U.S. or E.U..
please feel free to reach out to me:

> data looks disorganized, meaningless, and chaotic in its raw form, but if you're rigorous, humble, and patient, you might just catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden.
