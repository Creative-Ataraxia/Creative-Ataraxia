### Hi there, happy to see you!
---
I'm Roy, a U.S. senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience. I architect, modernize, and operate batch & streaming data platforms on AWS-native tooling for clients in manufacturing and financial services domains.

I worked with:
- Batch ETL (Spark, Redshift)
- Real-time Streaming (Kafka, Flink, Aurora); 
- Lakehouse Patterns (S3, Hudi, Athena);
- Data Modeling (PySpark, Bigquery, dbt);
- Platform IaC (Airflow, Kubernetes, Terraform);
- Governance (Lake Formation, KMS, IAM, CloudWatch);

My work combines independent ownership with measurable revenue impacts: cost savings, latency reductions, operational scaling, and tech debt reductions.

Outside of work, I enjoy building personal projects such as: [Batch ETL](https://github.com/Creative-Ataraxia/GA4-Analytical-Pipeline), [Stream Processing](https://github.com/Creative-Ataraxia/eonet-realtime-streaming) and LLM-related coding competitions, recently won  [Silver Medal](https://www.kaggle.com/certification/competitions/alexmason11/llms-you-cant-please-them-all) in a featured Kaggle LLM competition.

Here are some of the architectures I've worked with:
