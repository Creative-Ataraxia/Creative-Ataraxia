### Hi there.
---

I'm Roy, a Data & AI engineer with a systems architect's mindset. I focus on designing practical, scalable infrastructure to solve real business problems, not just writing code for code’s sake.

* I enjoy tackling complex challenges with a mix of structured thinking, intuition, and curiosity.
* I engineer robust data pipelines, deploy agents and RAG systems, and optimizing real-time data workflows.
* I build data platforms that balance scale, observability, and governance:
	- Lightweight local stacks (Dagster + dbt + DuckDB)
	- Or fully scalable cloud systems (Fivetran/Kafka/Flink → Lakes(S3/ADLS/GCS) → Spark/dbt → DWH(BigQuery/Snowflake) → Monte Carlo/DataDog → CICD(Docker/K8s).

I have a background in business development, and am a proactive team player, I believe in the power to achieve great things when we all work together! I also a U.S. national, and do not need any work authorizations to work in the U.S., and I'm open to relocation.
