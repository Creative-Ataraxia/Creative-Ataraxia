### Hi there.

### About
I'm a senior Data & AI engineer who builds analytics & ML systems. I design and operate scaling cloud-native data platforms that stay fast, observable, and reliable. My bias is toward solving revenue-bearing problems: governance, lineage, and cost control that come baked-in, not bolted-on.

### Experiences:
* Streaming & ELT at scale: AWS Kinesis Streams, Flink(KDA), S3 / Redshift RA3, Glue & PySpark on EMR, Dagster / Airflow on EKS
* Data-contracted warehouses: dbt, Great Expectations, Terraform/CDK
* End-to-end ML & LLM integration: SageMaker (batch + real-time), DynamoDB Feature Stores, Bedrock / OpenAI APIs, vector DBs
* Ops: GitHub Actions CI/CD, IaC modules, observability (Prometheus / Grafana / Monte Carlo)

### Quick stats
* Kaggle rank: top 0.8 %, featured LLM competitions.
* Teams grown: mentored 4 engineers; instituted ADR-based design review rubrics.
* Costs saved: â‰¥ $300k / yr via dynamic warehouse sizing & streaming optimisations.

I'm fully authorized to work in U.S., no visa sponsorship needed now or ever. I'm open to relocation to any part of the U.S. Please feel free to reach out to me:
