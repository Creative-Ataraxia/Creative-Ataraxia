### Hi there.
---
I'm Roy, a Data & ML Engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade data platforms for both streaming, analytical, and ML systems.

I design and operate end-to-end pipelines using AWS-native tools like Kafka (MSK), Flink, Glue, Hudi, Redshift, and Lake Formation. I pay more attention to mission-critical and revenue-impacting works such as real-time streaming, lakehouse architecture, spark job tuning, and access governance.

I enjoy experimenting with popular OSS stacks (currently Airbyte, Dagster, dbt, DuckDB).

Here are some of the architectures I've worked with:
