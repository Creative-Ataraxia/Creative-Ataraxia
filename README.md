### Hi there.
---

I'm Roy, a senior Data & AI engineer with a systems architect's mindset. I focus on designing practical, scalable infrastructure pipelines to solve real business problems, not just writing code for code’s sake.

* I enjoy tackling complex challenges with a mix of structured thinking, intuition, and curiosity.
* I engineer robust data pipelines, deploy agents and RAG systems, and optimize real-time data workflows.
* I build data platforms that balance scale, observability, and governance as required by your data team:
	- Lightweight local stacks (Airbyte + Dagster + dbt + DuckDB + Docker)
	- Or fully scalable cloud systems (Fivetran/Kafka/Flink → Lakes(S3/ADLS/GCS) → Spark/dbt → DWH(BigQuery/Snowflake) → Monte Carlo/DataDog → CICD(Docker/K8s).
* I also have four years of full-time experience integrating LLMs into my workflows. I'm proficient in most prompt tuning techniques and structures, and good at steering LLMs to produce the outputs we want. More recently, I’ve fully embedded myself in LLM-centric workflows, basically functioning as a kind of the “human agent” within AI agent pipelines.

I'm a U.S. national, so I'm authorized to work in the U.S., and I'm open to relocation to any parts of the U.S. or E.U..
