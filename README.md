### Hi there.

### About
I'm a senior Data & AI engineer who builds data pipelines for analytics & ML systems. I design and operate cloud-native data platforms at scale that are fast, observable, and reliable. My focus is on solving revenue-bearing problems: data governance, lineage, and cost control features to make sure your data operations are prompt, trustworthy, and cost-efficient. 

### Experiences:
* Streaming & ELT at scale: AWS Kinesis Streams, Flink(via KDA), S3/Redshift RA3, Glue & PySpark on EMR, Airflow/Dagster on EKS
  * Delivered 5min freshness on TBs of facts and <5s dashboard queries.
* Data-contracted warehouses: dbt, Great Expectations, schema-enforced, Terraform/CDK
  * Re-platformed 70+ legacy feeds, reducing schema-breaks from 52 to 3 per year.
* ML & LLM in production: SageMaker (batch/real-time), Feature Stores (DynamoDB), Bedrock/OpenAI APIs, vector DBs
  * Served 4 fraud-detection models and RAG systems that deflects 45% of L1 tickets.
* Ops: GitHub Actions CI/CD, IaC modules, observability (Prometheus / Grafana / Monte Carlo)

If you need real-time analytics, governed self-service data, or LLM features that solves real business problems, please feel free to reach out to me:
