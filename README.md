### Hi there.
---
I'm Roy, a Data & ML Engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade data platforms for both streaming, analytical, and ML systems.

I design and operate end-to-end pipelines using AWS-native tools like Kafka (MSK), Flink, Glue, Hudi, Redshift, and Lake Formation. I pay more attention to mission-critical and revenue-impacting works such as real-time streaming, lakehouse architecture, spark job tuning, and access governance.

I enjoy experimenting with popular OSS stacks (currently Airbyte, Dagster, dbt, DuckDB).

I would be happy to explore any senior data engineering roles with your organization, please free feel to reach out to me here:

- I'm fully authorized to work in U.S., no visa sponsorships are needed now or in the future, I'm natively fluent in English, and I'm open to relocation to any parts of the U.S., E.U., or East Asia.
