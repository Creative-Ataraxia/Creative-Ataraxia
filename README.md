### Hi there.
---
Senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience. I architect, operate, modernize, and scale end-to-end data pipelines on AWS-native tooling for clients in manufacturing and financial services domains.

I worked on:
- Real-time ingestion (Kafka/Flink), lakehouse architectures (S3/Athena, Hudi, Redshift Spectrum), platform-level automation (Glue, Lambda, Lake Formation).
- Streaming pipelines processing 4,000+ factory feeds, and architected self-service analytical layers for thousands of daily queries. 
My work combines independent ownership with measurable revenue impacts: cost savings, latency reduction, and operational scaling.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with popular open-source [data stacks](https://github.com/Creative-Ataraxia/CLV-data-pipeline) (currently Airbyte/Dagster/dbt/DuckDB/Docker) and LLM workflows. I recently placed in the top 3% of an LLM prompt engineering competition [Kaggle Silver Medalist](https://www.kaggle.com/certification/competitions/alexmason11/llms-you-cant-please-them-all).

Here are some of the architectures I've worked with:
