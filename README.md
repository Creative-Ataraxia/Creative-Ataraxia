### Hi there, hope you're having a great day!

I'm Roy, a senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience. I architect, modernize, operate, and scale end-to-end data pipelines on AWS-native tooling for clients in manufacturing and financial services domains.

I worked on:
- Real-time Streaming (Kafka, Flink, S3, Aurora); 
- Lakehouse Patterns (S3, Hudi, Redshift Spectrum, Athena);
- Data Modeling (Glue, Spark);
- Platform IaC (Airflow, Terraform, Kubernetes/EKS);
- Governance (Lake Formation, KMS, IAM, CloudWatch);

My work combines independent ownership with measurable revenue impacts: cost savings, latency reductions, operational scaling, and tech debt reduction.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with popular open-source [data stacks](https://github.com/Creative-Ataraxia/eonet-realtime-streaming) and LLM workflows. I recently placed in the top 3% of a featured Kaggle LLM prompt engineering competition [Silver Medalist](https://www.kaggle.com/certification/competitions/alexmason11/llms-you-cant-please-them-all).

Here are some of the architectures I've worked with:

Currently open to any data engineering roles (junior, senior, EM) and/or ML-adjacent roles involving platform architecture, real-time streaming systems, or ML/LLM Ops/integrations with your team.
