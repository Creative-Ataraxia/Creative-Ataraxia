### Hi there! Hope your day have been going well.
---
Senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience. I architect, modernize, operate, and scale end-to-end data pipelines on AWS-native tooling for clients in manufacturing and financial services domains.

I worked on:
- Real-time Streaming (Kafka, Flink, S3, Aurora); 
- Lakehouse Patterns (S3, Hudi, Redshift Spectrum, Athena); 
- Platform Orchestration (Glue, PySpark, EMR, Airflow, Terraform);
- Data Governance (Lake Formation, KMS, IAM, CloudWatch);

My work combines independent ownership with measurable revenue impacts: cost savings, latency reductions, operational scaling, and tech debt reduction.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with popular open-source [data stacks](https://github.com/Creative-Ataraxia/CLV-data-pipeline) (currently Airbyte/Dagster/dbt/DuckDB/Docker) and LLM workflows. I recently placed in the top 3% of a featured Kaggle LLM prompt engineering competition [Silver Medalist](https://www.kaggle.com/certification/competitions/alexmason11/llms-you-cant-please-them-all).

Here are some of the architectures I've worked with:

Open to any data engineering roles (junior, senior, EM) and/or ML-adjacent roles involving platform architecture, real-time streaming systems, or ML/LLM Ops/integrations with your team.

- I'm fully authorized to work in U.S., so no visa sponsorships are needed now or in the future, and I'm open to relocation to any parts of the U.S., E.U., or East Asia.
